ga-‚llbladder was very large, and -
full of bile3 not yellow, but of ι’
dark g'r'een, and too viscid. There
was no scirrhofity m the liver3
but in what part soever it was‘
cut, the same sort of bile iffued;
In fine, we observed, that every part
osthehody, memb'ranes‚fat,g1ands;
nay, the very substance of the ribs,¹

waso ofa yellow hue, except the .

’ musculas fihres alone, which were
not in the least tinged. Upon
preffing the gall· bladder with the

fingers, we could not force one

⁹ drop of bile into the intestihes3 . ·

forat the union 'of tho hepatie
du& with the cystic‚ the pahage was
‚so vastly streightened‚ that 1t would
not admit a style. And my reason
for relating this case ts, to make ap·
peut, from how man different
ι causes, and some of th e,fatal this
disease may arise. ,
