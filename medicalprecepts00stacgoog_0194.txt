170 ’ Os the dropsy.

Aur> this monument is how to

be seen in Bunhil-Fields. ·

Eounnrr remarkable, but hap—
pier in the event, is the case con-
tained in the following account. A
maiden gentlewoman of seventeen

years of age, observed, that her
belly swelled gradually, and that

lhe made but little urine. She
took various medicines, but still
, ¹grew worse fora whole year 3 when
her abdomen was as much distended
as ¹if {he had been far gone with
child. At this junelure {he mar-
ried, in hopes that a hulband would
prove her best phyfician. But it
happened quite otherwise3 the
dropsy went on encreafing for three
years, when it carne to that height,
-that there was reason to fear her
κ belly would burst. Her pain be-
coming now intolerable‚ lhe desued
me to order her to be tapped bya

surgeon.
