Ostha human'body. ’ 3

⁶ · Bur this wonderful machine, in· ,
capable of putting itself into mo-
tion, was still in want of a first
movet: wherefore the mind is pla-
* 'ced over it, as a ruler and modess
rator, and is the efficient cause of
all sense and motion. For whe-
ther this principle refides in the
head, as in its citadel 3 or whether
’ it has no stxedplace, but is dffersed
all over the boeth, according to the
, opinion bf Xenocrates, a disciple
of Plato (1,); it commands within
us, and directe the whole. Now,
our motiens, as well as our senses,
are twofold, internal and external:
the internal have not only the vital
parte, as the beart, lungs, -stomach
and intestines, subject to them, but
likewise all the nervous mem·
branes.
