‘ Os the scurvye' '25‘5
use= of medicines proper in the
scurvy, Imean bitters and diuse-
'tics, he seemed to grow better: for
’ one of the ulcers was by chirur-
gical applicatione entirely healed3
but while the other was under cure,
¹ 'a gan rene seiaed the part unex-

pededly3 which being scarified‚ in
- 'order to check its progresr, the pa-
tient died suddenly. Upon open-
ing the abdomen, we were struck
with amazement at the monstrous
fize of the spleen. For it weighed
five pounds and a quarter, whereas ,
the liver weighed but four pounds
and a quarter. But its bulk seemed
tolbe its *only dese& ε for it retained
its natural ssrape and color, and
had not the least seirrhofity or other
hardness :¹ and its infide was, ,aa
usual, ofa dark livid hue,' with ·

‘ lax fibres, anddeep-colored blood.
