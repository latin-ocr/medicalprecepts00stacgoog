Ι Of tle =o’ropsy. 145

ΒΕ sto r s all these collestions of

· ‘ water, other parts of the body are

also liable to the same distempen
· as for example, the brain an'd testi-
cles. But water is <no where at-
tended with greater danger than
when collened in the breast :v and

this species of dropsy most eom-⁶
monly happens to those, who have

. long laboured under avdifficulty of

breathing‚ that sort especially which
- arises from polypi in the blood-ves-
, sels 3 while the serosrties os the blood
transude through the membraneos '
the lungs. I have seen several cases
os this kind, where there was from
a pint to a quart of water collesled5

· sometimes in one srde of the breast

, only, sometimes in both, and some-

· times also in the very mediastinum.
Now, as this water encreases daily
in quantity, by hindering the play
of the lungs, it at length stops respi-
ration‚ and the patient dies sud-¹
U denly.
