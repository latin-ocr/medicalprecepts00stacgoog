· ΗΕ name of scurvy is given

by medical writers to adis-
ease so various and different in ap-
pearance, that it does not seem
to be one and the same distemper.
In the northern countries it hasal-
ways been common, and the nearer
they are to the sea, the more severe
it proves z accordingly the Danas,
Norwegianr, and other inhabitants
of the coasts of the Baltic are vastly
afflisted with it; nor do the Ger-
mmn, Dutch, or our own coutr-
ttymen escape its fury (1)
