, 306 Os the regimentost lise ,-

Phyfictans are agreed, that copulandi,

When age adult and high· ·btaced nerven invite,
Should neither be immod’ rately dein d

Nor dreaded to excess. The good old man
Is by his tame frio gidity admonith d

Not to engage in thedull drudgery,

Mistaken for enchanting stenes of pleasute3
Lest thus he snap his feeble thread of life.

But what more base, more noxious to the body,

Than by the power of fancy to excite Ι
Such lewd idea’ s of an absent objed,

As rouze the organs‚ form d for nobler ends,
To ndh' into th' embrates of a phantom,
And do the deed of personal enjoyment! -

In? int this nuth ought tn be⁰
deeply imprinted in every mind,
that this, and indeed all other, „

Voluptates commendat rarior usus.

Pleasures are highten’d by a sparing use.

Fon my part, aster matut'e enn-
fideration, lam long since coine
to this way of thinking. That al·
though plensutes‚ richen, - powet,
and other‘ things which ate called
the gists of fortune, seem to be
dealt out to mankind ivith too much

partiality· ,
