Of tha gutta serena. aoy·
struaion. Agaim 'this disease is
sometimes owing to a passy of the
nerves of this same membrano 3 as
it in some measure destroys their
senfibility3 whereby the impulse
of the corpuscles of light on them
is not sufficient to make them
transmit obje&s to the brain. In
fine, I have observed‚ that this
species of blindness is also occafion·
ed by a pressure on the optic nervos,
either by the extravasation of a
Ι glutinous humor, or by a hard tn-
mor formed upon the place, where·
they pass from their thalami into the
eyes3 whereby the passage of the
animal spirits to the brain is totally
intercepted. ‘ ⁵

dent to the eye even in one disease.
Let us now ¹consider how to pre-
